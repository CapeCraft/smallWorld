# smallWorld

This is a program built to split up large worlds into smaller pieces for external download. Currently in development for the CapeCraft server for after the reset.  
Current coders are heek89 and mov51, two very inecxpernced java developers for what should be a very simple project.
  
Stand alone we plan to have it be a very simple program, something that can be opened with a few parameters and get a smaller world file with the selected regions. Intended to be used by placing it within the world folder you want to copy.
